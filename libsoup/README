Soup is an HTTP library implementation in C. It was originally part of
a SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) implementation, but the SOAP code
was later removed (and then later partially reimplemented...).

This is a newer version than the official SlackBuild at slackbuilds.org.
Make sure this is what you want.
